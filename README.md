# Elixir

Asset pipeline solution for QuorraJS

## Introduction

Quorra makes use of [Laravel's Elixir](https://github.com/laravel/elixir) module for asset pipelining. Elixir
provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic Gulp tasks for your Quorra application. Elixir supports
several common CSS and JavaScript pre-processors, and even testing tools.

If you've ever been confused about how to get started with Gulp and asset compilation, you will love Elixir!

## Official Documentation

Documentation for Elixir can be found on the [Quorra website](https://quorrajs.org/docs/v1/more/elixir).
